To begin, we will create a new contract that inherits from the ERC20 interface.

The code editor has been pre-loaded with the code for the ERC20 interface.

## What to do next: 

1. Add a new contract below the interface named ERC20 and inherit from the ERC20 interface.

2. Add the methods needed by the interface (leave them blank for now)

### Once you can compile and deploy, move on to the next section!`;
