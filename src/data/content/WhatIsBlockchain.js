According to Investopedia, a blockchain is a distributed database that is shared among the nodes of a computer network.
As a database, a blockchain stores information electronically in digital format. Blockchains are best known for their crucial role
in cryptocurrency systems, such as [Bitcoin](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bitcoin.asp), for maintaining a
secure and decentralized record of transactions. The innovation with a blockchain is that it guarantees the fidelity and
security of a record of data and generates trust without the need for a trusted third party.

## Early uses of blockchain:

The first mainstream blockchain innovation was Bitcoin. Bitcoin was a digital currency experiment, 
but is now the standard cryptocurrency with a market cap of over $800 billion dollars. 
The underlying technology behind bitcoin has been replicated and modified to create other blockchain networks, serving different purposes.

## Modern uses of blockchain:

In this course we will teach about interacting with the Ethereum Network. This network is a modified implementation of blockchain technology,
in that it allows decentralized applications to be run on a blockchain network via smart contracts. These smart contracts are programs 
written by users and have applications in finance, supply chains, and numerous other sectors. We will go into more detail about smart 
contracts in the next chapter.
