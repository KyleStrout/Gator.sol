## Constants

Constants are a type of variable in solidity. These variables are hard coded and can't be modified. They can be useful for saving gas costs or for storing data that's not meant to
be changed. Constants can only apply to state variables and cannot be used for expressions that make calls to external contracts or reach storage, execution, or blockchain data.
