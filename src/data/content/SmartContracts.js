# What is a Smart Contract?

Smart contracts are a collection of programs that are stored on the blockchain, and they run under 
certain conditions. When they run, the action takes place across a network of computers. One benefit 
of smart contracts is that they are automated; this means that whenever the predetermined conditions 
are met, the process will instantly occur. Smarts contracts make it so that a middle-man is no longer 
needed, and give blockchain's various uses more security. Finally smart contracts are immutable, 
which means they can not be changed. Once the contract is coded, it is there forever. In this course, 
we will look at smart contracts as the pertain to the Solidity.
