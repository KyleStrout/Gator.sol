## Enums

Enums are a way to define a set of named constants. Thus, a variable could be restricted to use only one of some predefined values. Enums are user defined types and are 
equal to enums in the C language. Each constant in an enum is called a "member".

Enums are useful for a few reasons. First, they can keep track of choices and/or state. They can also make code easier to read and maintain, 
as well as reduce the risk of bugs. A default value can also be assigned to an enum and enums must have at least one predefined member. 

Enums are critical to understand in solidity so there's two contracts in the editor. One for basic enums, and one for slightly more advanced enums that includes using structs and mappings.
