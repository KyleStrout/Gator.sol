const content = `Welcome to the best blockchain development course on the entire internet! After taking this course, you will understand everything from how a blockchain works to how to make decentralized applications using smart contracts. 

The course is divided into 4 different parts:
1. Blockchain Concepts
2. Smart Contracts
3. Solidity Beginner
4. Solidity Advanced

We will expect that you already know some programming, such as python or javascript. If you’re completely new to programming, we recommend you try an introductory course first. 

This course is designed to be interactive. For example, you might find a play button next to some content. Click the button to see what happens! 

<div id="play-button-example"></div>

To enhance your learning, you might throw some questions into the content. Don’t worry no one is grading you!

<div id="question-example-1"></div>

More complicated sections may include a code editor on the right for you to type code and compile in real time. Other sections may include pre-deployed smart contracts that you can interact with through a javascript console or HTML inputs and button. We’ll keep it as simple as possible. 

Enjoy and happy coding!`;
