# What is a Web3.js?

Web3.js is a library that allows users to interact with the Ethereum blockchain using the web. This 
means that any website, app etc. has the ability to interact with Ethereum and the blockchain. This 
is accomplished with the use of JSON-RPC, or JSON remote procdeure calls.

Please note that Web3.js is unrelated to the "Web 3.0" concept.
