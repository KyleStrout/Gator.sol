# What are some Real World Uses for Smart Contracts?

## Decentralized Finance (DeFi)

Currently, the financial world has the largest involvement in the smart contract and blockchain space. 
Centralized finance is when central authories control money. In the case of most, money is controlled 
by the government and by banks. Decntralized finances use programs in the place of banks, and since 
there is no controlling group at the top, cost are cheaper for everyone else. Many cryptocurrencies 
today are traded through centralized exchanges, such as Coinbase or Crypto.com. When selling on these 
webistes, fees are taken and taxes are necessary. As an alternative, a decentralized exchange can be 
used instead, which is cheaper and more secure.

## Gaming

Another area where smart contracts can be used is the gaming industry. In this case, certain games can 
feature NFTs, or non-fungible tokens. These are entirely unique to the owner. One example is Zed Run, 
a digital horse racing game. Players are able to buy horses on the market and race them against other 
players' horses. Smart contracts come to play in the breeding feature. A player is able to breed a new, 
entirely unique horse with their old one. These traits about the new horse come from its parents and 
are determined by what is programmed in the smart contract.

Other uses for smart contracts include applications in the legal industry, real estate, and the creation 
of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO).
