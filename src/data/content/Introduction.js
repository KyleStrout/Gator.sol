### In this project, we will use the everything we've learned so far to create a new ERC20 token. 


What is an ERC20 token?

Any contract that follow the ERC20 standard is a ERC20 token.

ERC20 tokens provide functionalities to

- transfer tokens
- allow others to transfer tokens on behalf of the token holder



### Some things you will need to remember from the course:

1. Mapping
2. Sending ether
3. Function visibility / modifiers
4. Inheritance

Good luck!`;
