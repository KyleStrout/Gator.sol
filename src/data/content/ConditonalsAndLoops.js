### Conditionals

Like other common languages, Solidity supports conditional statements <b>if</b>, <b>else if</b>, and <b>else</b>. 

Solidity also includes a ternary operator, which is a shorthand for an if-else statement.

### Loops

Solidity includes loops such as <b>for</b>, <b>while</b>, and <b>do while</b>.

Be careful using loops because an infinite loop can cause your contract to hit the gas limit which will cause the transaction to fail.
