# 4 Main Categories of Blockchain Networks:

This course covers the basics of a public blockchain, which is the most common and accessible type. However, 
there are other approaches to blockchain technology to make the network less distributed and more centralized.

  

## 1. Public

*   Most Popular
    
*   Information is distributed evenly among network
    
-   Non-restrictive and permissionless
    
-   Anyone on the internet can become an authorized node
    
-   Bitcoin, Ethereum
    
-   No owning entity
    

## 2. Private

-   Closed Network
    
-   Typically operate in small network or in an organization
    
-   Different permissions for different nodes
    
-   Consolidated power
    

## 3. Consortium

-   Preselected member nodes validate transactions
    
-   Multiple private networks collaborating and distributing control
    

## 4. Hybrid

-   Typically not public
    
-   Outside interaction is possible
    
-   Transactions cannot be altered by owning entity
    

  

It is important to remember that blockchain technology is normally referring to public blockchains,
 as this is the scheme that networks like Ethereum and Bitcoin implement. For the purposes of this course,
  the term blockchain will refer to a public blockchain.
