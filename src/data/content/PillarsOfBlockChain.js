# The Three Pillars of Blockchain

There are three essential concepts to understand regarding blockchain technology, they are: 
	

 - Decentralization - There is no central authority that governs the blockchain.
 - Immutability - Transactions and their information stored on the blockchain cannot be edited.
 - Transparency - All transaction records can be viewed by anyone connected to the blockchain network.

Please watch the short videos for each pillar to better understand the importance
of each.
