To see this token in meta mask, complete the following steps. 

1. Click 'compile'
2. Click 'Deploy'
3. Wait for the contracts to be deployed
4. Open metamask, click on the "assets" tab and scroll down to click on "import tokens";
5. Copy the contract address you just deployed called "ERC20" and paste that into the "Contract Address" field of the import tokens form.
6. It should auto fill in the "Token Name" and "Token Symbol" fields.
7. Once you can see your token in the assets tab, move on to the next step. 
8. Open the interaction panel and paste 1000000000000000000 (this is based off of 18 decimals) into the 'amount' field of the 'mint' function
9. Confirm the transaction, and then open metamask.
10. You should see your token in the assets tab with how ever much you minted.
