## Mappings

Mappings are a critical data structure to know in solidity. A mapping is a key value store where you can look data up by a key and get back a value.
Each key is unique in the mapping. This is similar to a hash table, but with a different implementation.

Mappings are useful because you can model arbitrary and complex data in a way that lets you treat the blockchain more like a database.

### Nested Mappings

Nested mappings are mappings that return other mappings. This is useful for storing data in a hierarchical structure. For example, you could store data that belongs to someone specifically
based off an address or something else.
