## Events

\`Events\`  allow logging to the Ethereum blockchain. Some use cases for events are:

-   Listening for events and updating user interface
-   A cheap form of storage

### Event Logging

Events are logged to the blockchain and can be queried. 

For example, events that were emitted during a transaction can be found in the transaction receipt.

Use the code on the right to log an event to the blockchain. Check the history tab once you're done to see the event
